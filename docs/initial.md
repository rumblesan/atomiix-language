## Functionality

This is the basic functionality that will be targeted for the MVP.

`<agentname> -> <pattern>`

Patterns can be the standard percussive, melodic or concrÃ¨te modes.

Percussive (letters represent samples):

mydrums -> |a  bcb d|
```
Melodic (numbers represent pitch):
```
mytune -> [1  232 4]
```
Concrete (numbers represent amplitude):
```
mysound -> {1  232 4}
```

### Add and remove effects

`<agentname> >> <effectname>`

```
myagent >> reverb >> lowpass

myagent << reverb
```

`<agentname> ))`
`<agentname> ((`
